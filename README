Given SQL configuration and data values, run that SQL configuration against
a database.

The intent is that this file(s) can be dropped into a web-application.
The web-app then parses them, creates forms on the fly for various
queries and sends those queries to the DB with the right criteria.

This is to do real quick queries, like mysqladmin.

- ConfigurationParser
Need piece that parses all configs & queries and puts them into a logical
data structure.

- QueryHandler
Takes in connection info, a query template and query data and hits the db.

- Interface
Talks to parser and displays forms.  At some point it should be able to 
take validation type information, number ranges, regex?
