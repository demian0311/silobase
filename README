SiloBase is a simple framework for running canned queries. 
You store connection information and SQL in an XML file, 
we prompt you to fill in the fields (if any) and run the 
query sending the results back to you.

This tool fits in a situation where you might want to run 
the same query but you don't want to always have a 
database console open or some other tool. It may also be 
good when you need to give users access to information 
but don't have a full-blown n-tier application in place. 
Of course you don't want to give your users database 
connection info or a tool like TOAD or MySQL Query Browser.

Tests won't work unless you have a database around.

TODO:
-  need to figure out how to access the xml file in a 
   container agnostic way.
   Perhaps this is getting the file via the classpath?
-  more formatting
-  better error handling and messaging
